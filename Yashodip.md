---

## üí≥ **Credit Logic & Purchase Flow** {#credit-logic}

### **üîÑ Purchase Flow Logic**

#### **Step 1: Feature Access Check**
```typescript
// Example: PDF Export
1. User clicks "Export PDF"
2. System calls: featureAccessService.canGeneratePDF()
3. Check subscription status first
4. If no subscription, check PDF credits
5. If no credits, show purchase dialog
6. If credits available, consume 1 credit and proceed
```

#### **Step 2: Credit Consumption**
```typescript
// Consumption Priority
1. Active Subscription = Unlimited (no consumption)
2. Credits consumed in FIFO order (oldest package first)
3. When package exhausted, automatically move to next package
4. If all credits consumed, require new purchase
```

#### **Step 3: Credit Increment/Decrement**
```typescript
// Purchase Success
- Add credits to existing balance
- Mark package as "Purchased"
- Reset consumption counter
- Update local storage

// Usage
- Decrement available credits by 1
- Track consumption per package
- Show remaining credits to user
```

### **üéØ Smart Purchase Validation**
```typescript
// Prevents duplicate purchases
1. Check existing subscription before allowing purchases
2. Warn if user has 30+ unused credits
3. Block incompatible purchases (e.g., monthly + yearly subscription)
4. Suggest subscription if user frequently purchases credits
```

# Add to android/app/build.gradle
android {
    ...
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS

            ...
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Step 3: Create Gradle Properties**
```bash
# Create/edit: android/gradle.properties
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=upload-keystore.jks
