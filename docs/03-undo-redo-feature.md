## Implementation Details

### Technologies Used

#### Core Technologies
- **SocialCalc Engine**: Built-in undo/redo functionality through SocialCalc spreadsheet engine
- **React Hooks**: Custom useKeyboardShortcuts hook for keyboard integration
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation with proper interfaces
- **Ionic React**: UI components for undo/redo buttons and feedback

#### Integration Components
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Standard Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y key combinations
- **Button Controls**: Visual undo/redo buttons in the interface
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for successful/failed operations
- **Context Management**: Proper state management for undo/redo operations

### Core Implementation

#### SocialCalc Integration
The undo/redo functionality leverages the SocialCalc spreadsheet engine's built-in history management. The engine maintains a command history stack that tracks all user actions and provides methods to traverse this history.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts Hook
A custom React hook manages keyboard shortcuts for undo/redo operations, ensuring consistent behavior across the application. The hook listens for standard keyboard combinations and prevents default browser behavior.

#### User Interface Integration
The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing user interface through button controls in the main menu and keyboard shortcuts. Visual feedback is provided through toast notifications and button state management.

### Key Functions and Methods

#### Core Functions
1. **undo()**: Executes undo operation through SocialCalc engine
2. **redo()**: Executes redo operation through SocialCalc engine
3. **useKeyboardShortcuts()**: Manages keyboard shortcut detection and handling
4. **handleUndo()**: Wrapper function with error handling and user feedback
5. **handleRedo()**: Wrapper function with error handling and user feedback

#### Helper Functions
1. **showToastMessage()**: Displays user feedback for operations
2. **preventDefault()**: Prevents default browser keyboard behavior
3. **EditorSheetUndo()**: SocialCalc engine undo method
4. **EditorSheetRedo()**: SocialCalc engine redo method

### User Interface Components

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Z**: Standard undo shortcut
- **Ctrl+Y**: Standard redo shortcut
- **Ctrl+Shift+Z**: Alternative redo shortcut (browser compatibility)

#### Visual Controls
- **Undo Button**: Menu option with undo icon
- **Redo Button**: Menu option with redo icon
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback messages
- **Button States**: Enabled/disabled states based on history availability
