## Implementation Details

### Technologies Used

#### Core Technologies
- **CryptoJS Library**: Version 4.2.0 for AES encryption and decryption
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption for data protection
- **Capacitor Preferences**: Secure local storage for encrypted data
- **React State Management**: Secure handling of password and encryption state

#### Security Features
- **Strong Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for maximum security
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password handling and validation
- **Memory Management**: Secure cleanup of sensitive data in memory
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage

### Encryption Implementation

#### File Encryption Process
When users save files with password protection, the system encrypts the document content using AES-256 encryption with the user-provided password as the encryption key.

#### Decryption Process
When accessing password-protected files, users must provide the correct password, which is used to decrypt the stored content and restore the original document.

#### Key Management
Passwords are not stored anywhere in the system; they exist only in user memory and are used directly for encryption/decryption operations.

### User Interface Integration

#### Password Entry
The system provides secure password entry interfaces for both saving and opening password-protected files, with proper input validation and user feedback.

#### File Identification
Password-protected files are clearly identified in the file list with appropriate icons and visual indicators to distinguish them from regular files.

#### Security Feedback
Users receive appropriate feedback about password strength, encryption status, and security-related operations through toast notifications and UI indicators.
